# Abstract

Harnessing the power of abstraction without compromise for drone applications: Developing a new Scala end-to-end development platform to write autonomous drone applications accelerated by FPGAs. The development platform is built on top of Spatial, a runtime code generator for DSL. The drone application consists in choosing the optimal trajectory to avoid colliding with moving objects by calculating all trajectories and predicting future positions in parallel and real-time while minimizing a cost function.
