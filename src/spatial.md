# Spatial implementation of an asynchronous Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter

### Parallel patterns

Parallel patterns ....

**TODO**

### Controls flows 

Control flows (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.
Sequential
Parallel
Pipeline:
	Inner Pipe: Basic form of pipelining; Pipelining of primitive instructions.
	Coarse-Grain: Pipelining of parralel patterns
	Stream Pipe: ASAP with FIFOs stack or Streams: Stream(*)
	
**TODO**
