# Master Thesis
by [Ruben Fiszel](https://github.com/paullepoulpe)

This is the source for the final report of my master's thesis at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch). In the report, I present the work I have done over 6 months at the Pervasive Parallelism Lab ([PPL](https://ppl.stanford.edu/)) in Stanford in conjunction with the Programming Methods Laboratory ([LAMP](http://lamp.epfl.ch)) at EPFL.
