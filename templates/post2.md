### About

This post is the part II out of IV of my [master thesis](/assets/thesis.pdf) at the [DAWN lab](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/), Stanford, under [Prof. Kunle](http://arsenalfc.stanford.edu/kunle) and [Prof. Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/) supervision. The central themes of this thesis are sensor fusion and spatial, an hardware description language (Verilog is also one, but tedious). 

This part is about scala-flow, a simulation library with a spatial-lang integration written to ease the prototyping, development and testing of applications that can be represented as data flows with some subpart going through spatial written accelerators.
