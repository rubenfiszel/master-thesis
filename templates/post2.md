This post is the part II out of III of my master thesis at the [DAWN lab](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/), Stanford. This part is about scala-flow, a simulation library with a spatial-lang integration written to ease the prototyping, development and testing of applications that can be represented as data flows with some subpart going through spatial written accelerators.
