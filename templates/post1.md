### About

This post is the part I out of IV of my [master thesis](assets/thesis.pdf) at the [DAWN lab](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/), Stanford, under [Prof. Kunle](http://arsenalfc.stanford.edu/kunle) and [Prof. Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/) supervision. The central themes of this thesis are sensor fusion and spatial, an hardware accelerator language (Verilog is also one, but tedious). 

This part is about an application of hardware acceleration, sensor fusion for drones. Part II will be about [scala-flow](https://github.com/rubenfiszel/scala-flow/), a library made during my thesis as a development tool for Spatial inspired by Simulink. This library eased the development of the filter but is also intended to be general purpose. Part III is about the development of an interpreter for spatial. Part IV about the spatial implementation of the asynchronous Rao-Blackwellized Particle filter presented in Part I. If you are only interested in the filter, you can skip the introduction.
