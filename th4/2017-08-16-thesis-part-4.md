### About

This post is the part IV out of IV of my [master thesis](assets/thesis.png) at the [DAWN lab](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/), Stanford, under [Prof. Kunle](http://arsenalfc.stanford.edu/kunle) and [Prof. Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/) supervision. The central themes of this thesis are sensor fusion and spatial, an hardware description language (Verilog is also one, but tedious). 

This part is about the spatial implementation of the asynchronous Rao-Blackwellized Particle filter presented in part I.
